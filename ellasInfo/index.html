          <p>
            I'm Elena, I am 36 years old and I am comming from Moldova, but
            above all I am:<strong
              ><em> Woman, Mother, Child and of course a Human.</em></strong
            >
            I was born in May, which means I love flowers and spring, I love
            happy companies and open minded people. I appreciate personalities
            with character, with principles, with dignity, as well as those who
            have a well-developed sense of humor. <br />
            As I mentioned above, I am a Mother and I have been raising my
            children for some time absolutely alone, which has changed my
            character and personality. And that's exactly what motivated me
            almost 6 years ago to emigrate from my home country - to Germany,
            and this decision was one of the best decisions since then. <br />
            Germany has adopted us as orphans and given us all this stability
            and an opportunity for a different future. Here I met beautiful
            people both face and soul. Here I discovered that
            <strong>"I can't"</strong>- it doesn't exist and if the
            <strong>Motivation and Desire</strong> is high - you can achieve
            success.
